Open source burrow mound classifier with a graphical interface

This is an open source archeological data (burow mound) analyser and classifier developed in Vilnius University and
Institute of Mathematics and Informatics (Lithuania) by Valentas Kurauskas. The current version works with raster files in 
hfz format and is has so far some hardcoded lines which make the raster processor only work with LKS-94 (Lithuanian) projections.
In the nearest future I will make changes so that arbitrary projections and many raster data format can be accepted.
